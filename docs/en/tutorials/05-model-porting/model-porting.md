# Third-Party Model Integration: Convert, Upload, and Validate

| Item | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Who this is for | ML engineers and integration developers bringing a custom detector or classifier to CosmoEdge |
| What you will accomplish | Evaluate runtime compatibility, convert and upload a model, configure parsing, and complete image, video, and sustained-run validation |
| Prerequisites | Understand Pipelines and know the model input, output, preprocessing, postprocessing, and label order |
| Estimated time | About 40–60 minutes for x86 ONNX; Sophon or Rockchip conversion commonly adds 30–60 minutes |
| Device required | x86 requires an ONNX Runtime CosmoEdge build; Sophon and Rockchip require the actual target device and matching conversion toolchain |
| Final acceptance result | The model loads, its output is parsed correctly, image and video results pass, and it runs without resource failure on the target device |

Complete third-party integration in this order:

1. Confirm support conditions and the model contract.
2. Export ONNX; convert it into a chip-specific `bmodel` for Sophon or `rknn` for Rockchip.
3. Validate the artifact on the conversion host.
4. Upload and configure the model.
5. Run positive and negative image tests first.
6. Connect it to a video Pipeline.
7. Validate loading, parsing, events, and sustained operation.

“Upload succeeded” proves only that the file was accepted. It does not prove that operators, input shape,
output layout, and postprocessing are compatible with CosmoEdge.

## 1. Confirm Support Conditions

### 1.1 Current Backends and File Formats

| Target backend | File accepted by Add Model | Main file in an imported model package | Current runtime | Device condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x86 CPU | `.onnx` | `model.onnx` | ONNX Runtime CPU | x86_64 host and matching CosmoEdge build |
| Sophon | `.bmodel` | `model.nn` | Sophon BMRT | BM1688 or CV186X; the artifact must target the actual chip |
| Rockchip RKNN | `.rknn` | `model.rknn` | RKNN Runtime | RK3576, RK3588, or RV1126B; the artifact must target the actual chip |

`model.nn` is the internal file name in a CosmoEdge model package. It wraps the device model. When adding
an individual Sophon model in the UI, select its `.bmodel`; do not rename an extension to `.nn`.

PyTorch `.pt`, TensorFlow SavedModel, and other training-framework artifacts cannot be uploaded directly.
Export them to ONNX first. Sophon deployments then convert ONNX into a chip-specific `.bmodel`, while
Rockchip deployments produce a chip-specific `.rknn`. RK3576 and RV1126B `.rknn` artifacts are not interchangeable.

### 1.2 Contracts Beyond the File Format

| Contract | Required information |
| --- | --- |
| Model type | Detection, classification, keypoint, feature, or another type; the UI subtype selects a parser |
| Input | Name, type, shape, batch, and whether dynamic dimensions are fixed |
| Preprocessing | RGB/BGR, resize, padding color, normalization mean, and scale |
| Output | Tensor names, shapes, dimension order, and whether NMS is built in |
| Postprocessing | Model family, confidence, NMS/IoU, coordinate format, and maximum results |
| Labels | Exact class-ID and class-name order |
| Resources | File size, runtime memory, channel concurrency, and target frame rate |
| License | Whether model weights, training data, and export tools permit the intended use and distribution |

CosmoEdge currently includes parsers such as `YOLOV8_DET`, but “any ONNX file” is not automatically
compatible. Custom output, built-in NMS, dynamic shape, or unsupported operators may require a new parser
or runtime code.

### 1.3 Verified Capability vs Conditional Compatibility

- **Directly supported by current code**: Add `.onnx` on x86, add `.bmodel` on Sophon, and import packages
  containing `model.onnx` or `model.nn`; RKNN builds add `.rknn` and package it as `model.rknn`.
- **Reference evidence in this repository**: a YOLOv8 detector has completed x86 ONNX import, live overlay,
  and event output.
- **Still required on the target candidate**: validate your exact model, Sophon artifact, performance,
  resource usage, concurrency, and long-term stability.
- **Not promised from format alone**: other ONNX model families, other output layouts, and untested
  chip/quantization combinations.

## 2. Reproducible Example: YOLOv8n Person Detection on x86

This example exports the public YOLOv8n weights with fixed Ultralytics packages and detects COCO class
`person` in `data/test-video/Safety Helmet.mp4`. It validates single-stage detection, not the separate
No Safety Helmet classification task.

### 2.1 Prepare a Fixed Environment and Model

Reference environment:

| Item | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Python | `3.13.11` |
| Ultralytics | `8.2.84` |
| ONNX | `1.20.1` |
| ONNX Runtime | `1.26.0` |
| Export input | `1 × 3 × 640 × 640` |

Create an isolated environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install \
  "ultralytics==8.2.84" \
  "onnx==1.20.1" \
  "onnxruntime==1.26.0"
```

Download the pinned release asset and record the source hash:

```bash
curl -L \
  -o yolov8n.pt \
  https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v8.2.0/yolov8n.pt
sha256sum yolov8n.pt
```

On macOS, use `shasum -a 256 yolov8n.pt`.

Export and record the ONNX hash:

```bash
yolo export \
  model=yolov8n.pt \
  format=onnx \
  imgsz=640 \
  batch=1 \
  dynamic=False
sha256sum yolov8n.onnx
```

Keep the command output, Python and package versions, source-weight hash, and ONNX hash. Two files with the
same name but different hashes are different model candidates.

### 2.2 Pre-Conversion Checks

From the repository root, run the shared checker for ONNX validation and one zero-input inference:

```bash
python tools/check_onnx_model.py yolov8n.onnx
```

For dynamic inputs, repeat `--shape images=1,3,640,640`. Add `--json <output-path>` for a
machine-readable record. The script records dependency versions and the model SHA-256 without saving
inference tensors.

Pass criteria:

- `onnx.checker` reports no error;
- ONNX Runtime creates a session and performs one inference;
- input is the expected `1 × 3 × 640 × 640` float tensor;
- output shapes match the export log.

A zero-input test verifies loading, not detection accuracy.

### 2.3 Prepare Model Metadata

This example uses raw YOLOv8 detection output:

| Configuration | Example value |
| --- | --- |
| Main type | Detection |
| Subtype | `YOLOV8_DET` |
| Input size | `[640, 640]`, following the UI's height/width order |
| Resize | Keep aspect ratio and center-pad |
| Padding color | `114, 114, 114` |
| Color | RGB |
| Normalization | `0–1`, scale approximately `1/255` |
| Output | Raw YOLOv8 detection tensor; CosmoEdge applies thresholds and NMS |
| Labels | Original COCO 80-class order; only ID `0`, `person`, is enabled in the example Pipeline |

Print labels from the source model instead of reordering them manually:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
from ultralytics import YOLO
for class_id, name in YOLO("yolov8n.pt").names.items():
    print(f"{class_id}\t{name}")
PY
```

Stop and correct the export or implement a matching parser if the ONNX output already contains NMS, does
not use the expected raw YOLOv8 layout, or has a different label count.

::: tip About the Earlier VisDrone Screenshots Below
This page restores every UI screenshot from the earlier VisDrone walkthrough so that no operational step is
lost. Its ten labels are `pedestrian`, `people`, `bicycle`, `car`, `van`, `truck`, `tricycle`,
`awning-tricycle`, `bus`, and `motor`; do not copy them to the COCO YOLOv8n example. If you reuse VisDrone,
pin the model source, version, hash, I/O contract, and license. A screenshot is not reproducibility evidence.
:::

## 3. Sophon Path: Convert the Same ONNX to bmodel

Run this section only for a Sophon target. Record the conversion tool version, target chip, and model
candidate together.

When delegating the task to a coding agent, first read
[Agent-Assisted Development](/en/development/agent-assisted-development). An ordinary user states the target
device, model materials, business preference, and expected deliverable. The agent generates the run-local
contract through `scripts/agent/start.sh`, which copies named materials and selects a route. It reruns
`assess.sh` after task or authority changes, then runs `doctor.sh` in the actual Linux execution
environment. Once admitted, `convert_model.sh` and `verify.sh` record the toolchain, commands, hashes, and
layered evidence. Users do not hand-pick releases, images, or commands; the content below is an advanced
manual and troubleshooting reference.

When the user supplies an isolated Linux development host, account, and password and explicitly asks to
connect, that already confirms this task's remote execution. The agent creates a sanitized record and uses
the password only through `scripts/agent/connect.sh`'s interactive OpenSSH prompt; it does not ask again for
an SSH key or authorization form. Installation, privilege elevation, and device writes remain separate
decisions when they become necessary.

The formal executor currently begins with ONNX. `.pt` and `.pth` may be assessed as materials, but exporting
ONNX from the training framework is a separate requested or assessed stage. `doctor`, conversion, and the
evidence chain remain blocked while route assessment is unresolved. Do not install Ultralytics first,
perform one ad hoc export, and describe that as a fixed repository capability.

Separate an officially supported installation route, local capability, and this run's resolved identity.
Use the current [official TPU-MLIR installation instructions](https://github.com/sophgo/tpu-mlir#-installation)
at execution time. Supported wheel, source, and prebuilt-Docker routes are all candidates; they need not
match one exact release or directory layout from this page. A route becomes `READY` only when `tpu_mlir`
imports, compiler entries are callable, runtime libraries are intact, and the actual candidate passes
preflight. Admission then freezes package release, image ID/digest, Python, command paths, and hashes.

The official Sophon compiler path executes on Linux. Windows remains suitable for agent orchestration and
material preparation, but route this section's conversion to an isolated Linux x86_64 environment. Use a
compatibility layer only as an experimental route with explicitly accepted risk.

An official development image represents a base execution environment; capability checks determine whether
it also contains a complete compiler. Pulling, starting, or changing it requires separate authority, and
the resolved image identity must be recorded. The v3.2 image below is a reusable repository example, not
the only admitted version for every task; other upstream-supported routes are assessed by callable
capabilities.

### 3.1 Install and Verify Docker

Follow the [official Docker Engine installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for
the target operating system. Do not treat the earlier tutorial's single `apt` or `yum` command as a
universal installation method.

![Docker installation process shown in the earlier walkthrough](images/img_01.webp)

Check both the client and daemon after installation:

```bash
docker --version
docker info
```

![Checking the Docker installation with docker --version](images/img_02.webp)

On Linux, if non-root users must run Docker, follow Docker's post-install instructions for the `docker`
group and sign in again. Membership grants high host privileges, so follow the host security policy.

![Docker user-group configuration in the earlier walkthrough](images/img_03.webp)

### 3.2 Download and Load the Pinned Conversion Image

The commands below use the repository's existing v3.2 reference toolchain. Download the archive and record
its hash:

```bash
curl -L \
  -o sophgo-tpuc_dev-v3.2_191a433358ad.tar.gz \
  https://sophon-file.sophon.cn/sophon-prod-s3/drive/24/06/14/12/sophgo-tpuc_dev-v3.2_191a433358ad.tar.gz
sha256sum sophgo-tpuc_dev-v3.2_191a433358ad.tar.gz
```

![Downloading the pinned Sophon TPU-MLIR image archive](images/img_04.webp)

Load the image and confirm its tag:

```bash
docker load -i sophgo-tpuc_dev-v3.2_191a433358ad.tar.gz
docker images sophgo/tpuc_dev
```

![Loading the Sophon conversion image with docker load](images/img_05.webp)

![Terminal output after the conversion image loads](images/img_06.webp)

Common commands:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `docker images` | List local images and tags |
| `docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/workspace" sophgo/tpuc_dev:v3.2 bash` | Start the pinned image and mount the current directory |
| `exit` | Leave the container; `--rm` also removes the stopped temporary container |

### 3.3 Start the Container and Check the Tools

Put `yolov8n.onnx` in the current directory and start the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  -w /workspace \
  sophgo/tpuc_dev:v3.2 \
  bash
```

![Starting the Sophon conversion container with a mounted model directory](images/img_07.webp)

The image should contain the conversion tools. Check `model_transform --help`, `model_deploy --help`, and
version output first. Install another package only if the pinned image actually lacks the commands, and
record its source and version instead of silently replacing the image environment.

![TPU-MLIR environment check shown in the earlier walkthrough](images/img_08.webp)

### 3.4 Transform to MLIR

The following command is for the pinned v3.2 reference image. Check the relevant `--help` before changing
toolchain versions. Inside the container, run:

```bash
cd /workspace
model_transform \
  --model_name yolov8n \
  --model_def yolov8n.onnx \
  --input_shapes '[[1,3,640,640]]' \
  --pixel_format rgb \
  --mlir yolov8n.mlir
```

![Where model_transform is run in the earlier VisDrone example](images/img_09.webp)

![Terminal output after model_transform creates the MLIR](images/img_10.webp)

If the model needs explicit output names, mean, scale, or a test input, use the actual export contract and
that tool version's help. Do not copy VisDrone-specific arguments from the screenshot.

### 3.5 Compile a bmodel for the Target Chip

BM1688 F16 example:

```bash
model_deploy \
  --mlir yolov8n.mlir \
  --quantize F16 \
  --chip bm1688 \
  --model yolov8n_bm1688_f16.bmodel

model_tool --info yolov8n_bm1688_f16.bmodel
sha256sum yolov8n_bm1688_f16.bmodel
```

Passing x86 preflight in a newer ONNX environment does not prove that the same file is accepted by the
selected TPU-MLIR. Combine the [ONNX versioning rules](https://onnx.ai/onnx/repo-docs/Versioning.html) and
[ONNX Runtime compatibility guidance](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/reference/compatibility.html) with checks
of the actual candidate's IR, opset, and operators in the frozen compiler. If incompatible, re-export a
supported ONNX from the source weights; do not edit `ir_version` to pretend it is compatible.

![Where model_deploy is run in the earlier VisDrone example](images/img_11.webp)

![The generated bmodel after conversion completes](images/img_12.webp)

CV186X requires a toolchain and chip option that support CV186X. A BM1688 artifact cannot be used on a
CV186X device. Unsupported operators, output mismatches, or compilation errors mean conversion failed;
renaming the extension does not fix them.

### 3.6 Validate After Conversion

Inspect model metadata first:

```bash
model_tool --info yolov8n_bm1688_f16.bmodel
```

Then use the toolchain's model runner and one fixed test image to compare boxes, classes, and scores across
the source framework, ONNX, and bmodel. Post-conversion evidence must include:

- toolchain version, chip option, and full command;
- ONNX, MLIR, and `.bmodel` hashes;
- input shape, output tensors, and model inspection;
- when test input exists, pre/post-conversion tensor comparison using a user override or the current tool's
  default tolerance policy, with that policy recorded;
- after device authorization, box, class, and score comparison across the source framework, ONNX, and
  target device on the same image;
- any F16 or quantization accuracy difference.

The agent path writes these results to the current run's `execution-manifest.json` and `evidence.md`.
Each rerun archives the prior manifest in the private run. A new `UNVERIFIED` result cannot erase a prior
failure; only a new measured `PASS` or an explicitly user-confirmed waiver with a reason explains the later
conclusion. Remote execution also records sanitized data-flow status without storing transfer credentials.
An entry is eligible as an official example only after two real recordings with a fixed toolchain, passing
tensor comparison, `conversion-verified` status, `active` lifecycle, and a still-valid verification seal.
The short code is only a seal reference. A `revoked` example keeps its historical recordings and seal but
cannot be selected or cited for compatibility. A normal candidate can still be delivered against its own
task acceptance, but it must not borrow another example's fixed shapes or hashes as proof.

The Sophon Add Model page requires a `.bmodel` file.

## Rockchip RKNN Path: Shared Backend, Target-Specific Artifacts

RK3576 and RV1126B share one CosmoEdge RKNN inference implementation, Rockchip media interface, and model
contract. Chip differences come from `config/rknn/platforms/<chip>.json`. A model spec does not hard-code a
chip, but every conversion binds one platform profile, so the resulting `.rknn` remains target-specific and
must not be copied between chips.

The agent-assisted flow always enters through `scripts/agent/convert_model.sh` and `verify.sh`. It selects
RKNN Toolkit2 from the task contract and freezes Python, wheel, platform profile, model spec, calibration
set, and artifact hashes. RK3576 and RV1126B do not maintain separate conversion scripts. For manual
diagnosis, follow the [RK3576 RKNN development guide](/en/guide/rk3576-rknn-development) and select the
actual target profile:

```bash
python tools/rknn/convert_model.py \
  --spec config/rknn/models/yolov8.json \
  --platform-profile config/rknn/platforms/rv1126b.json \
  --model yolov8-heads.onnx \
  --output yolov8-rv1126b-int8.rknn \
  --quantize --dataset calibration/dataset.txt
```

Conversion-host success is not device acceptance. Validate the matching Runtime/driver, numerical output,
image and video postprocessing, OSD, rules, alerts, the 5 FPS target, and stability on the actual device,
with results bound to the target chip and artifact SHA-256.

## 4. Upload and Configure the Model

### 4.1 Open Model Repository

Open **Model Repository**. Its list supports search and shows each model's type and related tasks.

![The model list and Add Model entry in Model Repository](images/img_13.webp)

Select **Add Model**. **Import Model** is for a complete model package, not the single-file path used here.

![Opening Add Model from Model Repository](images/img_14.webp)

### 4.2 Enter Details and Upload

1. Set the main type to **Detection**.
2. Select `YOLOV8_DET` only when it matches the output parsing contract.
3. Use a model name and description that identify the candidate version.
4. Select normalization and color channel.
5. Upload `yolov8n.onnx` on x86 or a bmodel compiled for the exact Sophon chip.
6. Save.

![The Add Model form for the earlier VisDrone bmodel](images/img_15.webp)

::: warning Screenshot Difference
The screenshot uses a Sophon VisDrone model, so it shows a `.bmodel` and VisDrone name. The x86 example on
this page uploads `yolov8n.onnx`. Both backends must use preprocessing and labels that match the artifact.
:::

Confirm that the entry appears in the list and record the model ID assigned by the system. The model is not
yet proven runnable.

![The newly added model in Model Repository](images/img_16.webp)

### 4.3 Configure Input, Postprocessing, and Labels

Open **Configure** and compare every item with the export record:

- input size and resize/padding;
- RGB/BGR and normalization;
- confidence and NMS thresholds;
- maximum retained targets;
- class IDs, names, and order;
- output or advanced settings shown by the page.

![Configuring input size, confidence, and NMS](images/img_17.webp)

![Configuring class IDs, thresholds, and label names](images/img_18.webp)

Save and reopen the page to prove persistence. The ten VisDrone labels in the screenshot apply only to that
model. Keep the original 80-class COCO order for this YOLOv8n, then enable only `person` in the video
Pipeline.

## 5. Image Validation: Prove Loading and Parsing First

The image path removes video decoding, tracking, and event rules from the problem, making model and parser
faults easier to isolate.

### 5.1 Create an Image-Analysis Task

Open **Task Configuration** and select **New Task**.

![The New Task entry in Task Configuration](images/img_19.webp)

Enter:

- task name: `YOLOv8n Person Image Validation`;
- data source type: **Image Analysis**;
- task type: **Detection / Analysis**.

![Entering the basic settings for an image-analysis task](images/img_20.webp)

Save and confirm that the task appears in the list with a normal status.

![The new image-analysis task in the task list](images/img_21.webp)

### 5.2 Arrange the Minimum Image Chain

Select **Arrange Algorithm** for the task.

![Opening Algorithm Arrangement from the image-analysis task](images/img_22.webp)

Add only **Object Detection** to keep the causal chain short.

![The Object Detection node in an image-analysis task](images/img_23.webp)

Select the uploaded YOLOv8n, enable only `person`, and save.

![Selecting the third-party model and labels in Object Detection](images/img_24.webp)

### 5.3 Upload Positive and Negative Samples

Open **Image Analysis** and choose `YOLOv8n Person Image Validation`.

![Selecting the newly created algorithm in Image Analysis](images/img_25.webp)

Prepare at least:

- one clear positive image containing a sufficiently large person;
- one negative image without a person;
- optionally, small, occluded, and edge-position targets.

Upload the images.

![An uploaded image waiting for analysis](images/img_26.webp)

Select **Start Analysis** and wait for the completed status.

![Completed image analysis with detected classes](images/img_27.webp)

Open details and inspect boxes, classes, confidence, and the result list.

![Boxes, classes, and confidence in image-analysis details](images/img_28.webp)

Pass criteria:

- model initialization reports no error;
- the positive image has a reasonably placed box labeled `person`, not an incorrect ID;
- the negative image does not produce many person boxes;
- confidence values are finite and plausible, not empty, NaN, or a fixed abnormal value.

Do not proceed to video while image validation fails.

## 6. Connect the Model to a Video Pipeline

### 6.1 Create a Video-Analysis Task

Return to **Task Configuration** and create another task.

![Entering the basic settings for a video-analysis task](images/img_29.webp)

Enter:

- task name: `YOLOv8n Person Detection Validation`;
- data source type: **Video Analysis**;
- task type: **Detection / Analysis**.

Save and confirm that the new task appears in the list.

![The new video-analysis task in the task list](images/img_30.webp)

### 6.2 Build the Minimum Acceptable Chain

Select **Arrange Algorithm** and start from the empty flow.

![The empty Algorithm Arrangement page for the new video task](images/img_31.webp)

Configure these components in order:

1. **Video Decode**.
2. **Object Detection**: select the uploaded YOLOv8n and enable only `person`.
3. **Tracking**.
4. **Category Filter**: keep `person`; start **Min Pedestrian Size** at `60`.
5. **Region Alarm**: use the main area and configure detection time.
6. **Event Report**: retain a snapshot for the first validation.

![Selecting the third-party model, labels, and frame sampling](images/img_32.webp)

![Connecting Tracking after the third-party detector](images/img_33.webp)

![The earlier quantity-limit region rule and its UI location](images/img_34.webp)

::: warning Current Rule vs Earlier Screenshot
The screenshot shows a quantity-limit rule suited to off-post or gathering use cases. This person-entry
validation should use the current **Region Alarm** semantics for the main area and detection time. Do not
copy the old quantity threshold into an intrusion chain mechanically.
:::

![Adding Event Report at the end of the Pipeline](images/img_35.webp)

Review model, tracking, region-rule, and event fields under **Parameter Configuration**, then save.

![Model, tracking, and region fields in the earlier detailed parameter page](images/img_36.webp)

The current action catalog has no standalone OSD component that must be inserted manually. Live boxes are
rendered from result metadata. First prove that **Video Decode → Object Detection** produces stable boxes,
then restore tracking, filtering, region, and report nodes one by one to isolate failures.

## 7. End-to-End Acceptance

### 7.1 Add a Test Channel

Prepare a video containing people. You can use `data/test-video/Safety Helmet.mp4` from this repository.
Open **Video Access** and add an **Offline Video** channel.

![Adding an offline channel and uploading a test video](images/img_37.webp)

::: warning Use the Current Capacity Message
The screenshot is from an earlier version, and its “maximum 1 GB” text is not a current fixed limit. Upload
now uses chunks and a safe-space check. Admission depends on the device's safe available space at that
moment; if capacity is insufficient, follow the required-space, available-space, and suggested-action
message in the UI.
:::

Wait for upload and channel processing to complete, then select **Service Assignment**.

![The Service Assignment entry after the offline channel is ready](images/img_38.webp)

### 7.2 Assign the Task, Region, and Running Strategy

Choose `YOLOv8n Person Detection Validation` from the task list.

![Selecting the third-party model validation task in Service Assignment](images/img_39.webp)

Add a detection region that covers where people move. If the region is too small, the model can draw boxes
without producing an event.

![Drawing and saving the detection region](images/img_40.webp)

Under **Running Strategy**, ensure the current time is in an active period. Offline Video Play Count accepts
`0–100`: `0` loops indefinitely, while `1–100` is the total number of plays.

![Configuring offline-video strategy and repeat count](images/img_41.webp)

Save and enable the service.

### 7.3 Check Live Inference

Open **Live Display** and choose the test channel.

![Selecting the third-party model test channel in Live Display](images/img_42.webp)

Select the validation task in algorithm-overlay settings.

![Selecting the third-party task as an algorithm overlay](images/img_43.webp)

Check that:

- video keeps playing;
- boxes appear at person locations;
- the class is `person`, and scores and coordinates vary with the image;
- segments without people do not show many fixed boxes;
- when tracking is enabled, one target remains reasonably continuous.

### 7.4 Check the Alert and Event Center

An alert should appear after a target satisfies the region and detection-time rules.

![An alert pop-up triggered by the third-party model task](images/img_44.webp)

Open **Event Center → Detection / Analysis** and query by task and channel.

![Third-party model detection records in Event Center](images/img_45.webp)

Confirm that the event snapshot has the correct box, class, channel, region, and time. If live boxes appear
but no event does, check the region, detection time, running strategy, and Event Report before changing the
model.

### 7.5 Sustained Operation

Run at least one full loop of the offline video and define a longer project-specific soak window. Record:

- process restart or crash;
- stable inference time and effective frame rate;
- host memory, device memory, and disk growth;
- continued parsing beyond the first frame;
- recovery after stopping and starting the task.

Production use must repeat capacity and stability acceptance at the target channel count, resolution, and
duration. A single-channel functional pass does not prove production capacity.

## 8. Failure Paths

### Upload Succeeds but the Model Cannot Run

1. Compare the uploaded-file hash with the export artifact.
2. Confirm ONNX for x86 and a bmodel for the exact Sophon chip.
3. Find the first model-initialization error: unsupported operator, shape, corruption, or insufficient memory.
4. Repeat ONNX Runtime or target-tool validation on the conversion host.
5. Confirm that the Pipeline selects the new model ID.

### The Model Runs but Output Parsing Is Wrong

Typical symptoms are no targets, out-of-range coordinates, one class for every target, or abnormal
confidence. Check:

1. subtype and parser;
2. output names, counts, shapes, and dimension order;
3. whether export built NMS into the graph;
4. `xywh` versus `xyxy` and normalized versus pixel coordinates;
5. label count and order;
6. RGB/BGR, resize, padding, and normalization.

If the output contract differs from an existing parser, implement or adapt postprocessing instead of hiding
the mismatch with arbitrary thresholds.

### Resources Are Insufficient

1. Stop other model tasks and test the minimum single-model chain.
2. Record memory before and after loading.
3. Lower frame rate only reduces work; it may not reduce resident model memory. Use a smaller model or
   suitable precision when the model itself cannot load.
4. Recheck accuracy after Sophon F16 or quantization.
5. Admit capacity at the target channel count instead of extrapolating linearly from one channel.

### Images Work but Video Fails

Check whether video preprocessing matches the image path, whether the ROI covers the target, whether frame
sampling is reasonable, and whether tracking, filtering, or event rules remove correct detections. Reduce
the Pipeline temporarily to **Video Decode + Object Detection**, then restore rule nodes one at a time.

### Live Boxes Appear but No Alert Is Created

Check in this order: the current time is in the running strategy; the ROI covers the target; the region rule
matches; detection time has elapsed; Event Report is connected; and the service is enabled. A successful
image analysis does not prove the event rule is active.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] The candidate has a source, version, input/output record, and SHA-256.
- [ ] File format, target backend, and device chip match.
- [ ] Pre-conversion and post-conversion checks pass.
- [ ] Model configuration matches preprocessing, postprocessing, and label order.
- [ ] Positive and negative image samples pass.
- [ ] The video Pipeline outputs correct boxes, classes, and events.
- [ ] The soak window has no crash, unbounded resource growth, or parsing interruption.
- [ ] Evidence is bound to the CosmoEdge version, model hash, device, and configuration.

All eight checks are required for a complete third-party integration. A successful upload or one correct
image result alone is not final acceptance.
